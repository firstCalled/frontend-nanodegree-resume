Resume website
========
Nov 29, 2014: This is the first commit of my resume project that I am building from the Udacity website. I have inserted basic contact info and a header. However, the profile pic I am trying to insert is not working. The JPG file is in the folder, but for some reason the compiler doesn't find it. I plan to fix that prior to the next upload.

Dec 27, 2014: Add additional information and formatting to the resume project. The portfolio pic problem has been fixed. It was a simple grammatical typo that caused the error. Work history has now been added to the profile. However, it only contains job titles and employers; no other details.

Jan 16, 2015: Resume has been further rounded out. Work Experience section has been completed and Projects and "Where I've Lived and Worked" sections has been added.  A Google Map appears on the page.
